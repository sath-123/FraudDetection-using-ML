# FraudDetection-using-ML
- An effective fraud detection system should be able to detect fraudulent transactions with high accuracy
and efficiency.It is necessary to prevent bad actors from executing fraudulent transactions,it is also
very critical to ensure genuine users are not prevented from accessing the payments system. A large
number of false positives may translate into bad customer experience and may lead customers to take
their business elsewhere.The existence of severely unbalanced data sets is a significant obstacle in
using ML in fraud detection.In the vast majority of datasets that are currently available, only a very
small percentage of transactions are fraudulent. Designing an accurate and effective fraud detection
system that effectively detects fraudulent activity while producing few false positives is a challenging
task.
